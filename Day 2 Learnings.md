# Advent of Cyber 2024:  Day 2: One man's false positive is another man's potpourri

### 1. Overview
Day 2 focused on exploring the concept of false positives in cybersecurity and how to analyze and manage logs for better threat detection and system monitoring. The task introduced participants to key security practices and tools to help distinguish real threats from benign events.

### 2. Key Tools Used
- Log Analysis Platforms: A simulated logging system was used to collect and analyze logs. This helped demonstrate how events are recorded and how anomalies are detected.
- Pattern Matching Tools: Tools such as grep or built-in platform search filters were employed to find specific patterns or events in the logs.
- Incident Tracking: Participants learned to investigate and interpret system events to identify potential issues.

### 3. Concepts Covered
#### False Positives and False Negatives:
- False Positives: Benign events flagged as threats, leading to unnecessary investigations.
- False Negatives: Genuine threats that are overlooked, posing risks to the system.

#### Log Review and Management:
- Understanding how logs capture system activities, network traffic, and user actions.
- Learning to filter and analyze logs for meaningful insights.

#### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
- Identifying suspicious patterns, such as unusual IP addresses, unauthorized access attempts, or abnormal usage trends.

#### Mitigating Noise in Logs:
- Techniques to reduce irrelevant data in logs and focus on actionable insights.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned
Efficient Log Analysis: Gained hands-on experience analyzing logs to filter out unnecessary noise and focus on potential threats.
Understanding Anomalies: Learned to identify deviations from normal patterns and classify them as benign or suspicious.
Critical Thinking in Security Analysis: Developed the ability to question results and cross-check details to avoid jumping to conclusions.
Importance of Context: Recognized how context is crucial in distinguishing between legitimate and suspicious activities.

### 5. Essential lessons
Completing Day 2â€™s task enhanced my understanding of log analysis and its importance in cybersecurity. I gained practical experience using tools to investigate and interpret logs, a foundational skill for monitoring systems and identifying potential threats. By understanding the balance between false positives and false negatives, I improved my ability to assess risk and prioritize security efforts effectively.
This task reinforced the importance of thorough analysis and the value of a methodical approach to cybersecurity investigations. It serves as a strong step forward in my learning journey.
