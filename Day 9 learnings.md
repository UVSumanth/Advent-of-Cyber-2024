# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 9 - Nine o'clock, make GRC fun, tell no one.

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 9 focused on the essential role of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in cybersecurity, specifically in the context of evaluating third-party risk. This task involved understanding how GRC ensures organizational security aligns with legal, regulatory, and operational requirements. The exercise highlighted the process of conducting a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks posed by third-party vendors.

### 2. Tools Used:
Risk Assessment Templates:
Predefined structures to systematically evaluate and document risks.
Spreadsheets or Risk Management Software:
For tracking identified risks, their likelihood, and potential impact.
Incident Logs and Documentation Tools:
To record observations and insights during the assessment process.
Online Resources on Compliance Standards:
Referenced guidelines like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 to ensure proper alignment.

### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):
Governance: Setting security strategies, policies, and roles within an organization.
Risk: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities and threats.
Compliance: Ensuring adherence to external regulations and internal standards.
#### Risk Assessment Process:
Identification: Understanding potential risks and attack vectors.
Likelihood: Assigning probabilities to risks materializing.
Impact: Quantifying the consequences of a risk being realized.
Mitigation: Developing strategies to reduce or accept risks.
#### Third-Party Risks:
Evaluating external vendors and service providers for potential vulnerabilities.
Understanding supply chain risks and their implications on organizational security.
#### Risk Register:
A tool to log, prioritize, and monitor risks over time.
Includes fields for risk owners, mitigation plans, and periodic reviews.
#### Critical Regulations:
Importance of aligning security practices with standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
#### Conducting Risk Assessments:
Learned to systematically identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks.
Gained familiarity with assigning likelihood and impact ratings to prioritize risks.
#### Understanding Third-Party Security:
Gained insights into the vulnerabilities introduced by external vendors.
Explored methods to assess and minimize risks in the supply chain.
#### Developing Mitigation Strategies:
Learned to balance risk reduction efforts with cost-effectiveness.
Understood when to accept, transfer, or mitigate risks based on organizational priorities.
#### Improving Documentation Skills:
Practiced logging risks in a risk register, ensuring clarity and traceability.
Developed clear communication strategies for presenting findings to stakeholders.

### 5. Achievement
Day 9 emphasized the importance of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) as a cornerstone of organizational cybersecurity. By walking through the risk assessment process, I learned how to identify and address vulnerabilities methodically while considering both internal and external factors. This task provided a practical perspective on managing risks and ensuring compliance in a real-world context.
