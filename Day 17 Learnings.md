# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 17 - He Analyzed and Analyzed Till His Analyzer Was Sore!

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 17 of Advent of Cyber 2024 focused on network traffic analysis to uncover suspicious activity. The task emphasized the importance of understanding communication patterns and identifying anomalies that could indicate malicious intent. This hands-on exercise provided a deep dive into packet capture (PCAP) files and the tools used to analyze them.

### 2. Tools Used:
#### Wireshark:
A powerful packet analysis tool for examining network traffic in detail, filtering specific data, and following communication streams.
#### Command-Line Utilities:
Tools such as tcpdump and tshark were referenced for capturing and analyzing packets in a more streamlined manner.
#### PCAP Files:
Pre-captured traffic files were analyzed to uncover patterns and anomalies.

### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Network Traffic Analysis:
Understanding the structure and flow of network communication.
Identifying potential signs of malicious activity within network traffic.
#### Packet Analysis Fundamentals:
Gaining insight into how data is transmitted over a network using protocols such as HTTP, TCP, and DNS.
Recognizing anomalies that could indicate attacks, such as unusual requests or data exfiltration attempts.
#### Incident Investigation Workflow:
Following a structured approach to analyze network traffic for forensic purposes.
Correlating findings with potential threats or vulnerabilities.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
#### Filtering and Analyzing Traffic:
Learned to apply filters to focus on specific protocols or communication flows, making analysis more efficient.
#### Protocol Understanding:
Improved knowledge of how protocols function, what normal traffic looks like, and how to identify deviations from the norm.
#### Anomaly Detection:
Gained experience spotting signs of potential malicious activity, such as unusual data sizes, unauthorized connections, or strange payloads.
#### Storytelling Through Traffic:
Developed the ability to interpret and narrate the story behind captured traffic, piecing together events to uncover potential incidents.

### 5. Achievement
Day 17 was a rewarding experience that combined technical skills with investigative thinking. It demonstrated how network traffic can reveal critical insights about system activity and security. This task reinforced the importance of thorough analysis in identifying threats and helped build confidence in using tools like Wireshark for effective network defense.
