# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 20 - If You Utter So Much as One Packetâ€¦

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 20 revolved around analyzing network traffic to identify anomalies, trace malicious activity, and understand how attackers exploit weaknesses in network protocols. This task emphasized the importance of network traffic monitoring in cybersecurity and provided hands-on experience with packet analysis.

### 2. Tools Used:
Wireshark:
Used to capture and analyze packets, filter specific traffic, and dissect protocol details.
Traffic Filters:
Applied filters to isolate relevant packets for detailed investigation.
Command-Line Tools:
Leveraged lightweight utilities for capturing and processing network data when appropriate.

### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Network Traffic Analysis:
Understanding how network traffic flows and how to capture it for analysis.
Recognizing the importance of analyzing packets to detect suspicious activities.
#### Protocol Insights:
Learning about common network protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP/UDP) and how attackers misuse them.
Identifying key fields within protocol headers that reveal critical information about the communication.
#### Anomaly Detection:
Spotting irregularities in traffic patterns that could indicate malicious behavior, such as unusual packet sizes, unexpected connections, or unauthorized data exfiltration.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
Packet Analysis:
Gained hands-on experience with dissecting packets to uncover valuable details such as source/destination IPs, ports, and payload data.
Identifying Malicious Behavior:
Learned to recognize signs of common attack vectors, including suspicious connections, data leaks, and protocol misuse.
Filtering Techniques:
Practiced using filters to focus on specific traffic, enhancing efficiency in analyzing large packet captures.
Security Awareness:
Developed a deeper understanding of how network monitoring plays a vital role in detecting and responding to cyber threats.

### 5. Achievement
Day 20 was an eye-opening experience, offering practical knowledge of how to analyze network traffic and uncover malicious activity.
