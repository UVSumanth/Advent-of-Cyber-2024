# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 3 - Even if I wanted to go, their vulnerabilities wouldn't allow it

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 3 focused on understanding web application vulnerabilities, identifying potential weak points, and learning how to mitigate security risks. The exercise involved analyzing a fictional scenario where a vulnerable web application was exploited by an attacker, highlighting the importance of securing online platforms.


### 2. Tools Used:
Burp Suite: Used for intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests and responses.
OWASP ZAP: A tool for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in web applications.
Browser Developer Tools: To inspect web elements and debug client-side issues.

### 3. Concepts Covered:
##### Common Web Vulnerabilities:
SQL Injection: Exploiting databases by injecting malicious SQL queries.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): Gaining unauthorized access by manipulating object references.
##### Web Application Security Basics:
Understanding how vulnerabilities arise from poor coding practices.
The role of user input validation and output sanitization.
##### HTTP Methods and Status Codes:
Recognizing different request methods (GET, POST) and interpreting HTTP status codes for troubleshooting.
##### Importance of Secure Authentication:
Identifying flaws in login mechanisms and preventing brute force or session hijacking attacks.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
##### Vulnerability Scanning:
How to use automated tools to detect weaknesses in web applications.
##### Manual Testing:
Observing and manipulating HTTP requests to uncover issues missed by scanners.
##### Exploitation and Mitigation:
Simulating attacks to understand the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
Learning best practices for fixing vulnerabilities, such as using parameterized queries, input validation, and proper session management.
##### Awareness of Real-World Implications:
Appreciating the risks that insecure web applications pose to users and organizations.

### 5. Achievement
This task reinforced the importance of proactive security measures in web development. By identifying vulnerabilities and understanding how attackers exploit them, I gained hands-on experience in web application security and the steps required to build safer systems. This exercise also highlighted the value of continuous learning in staying ahead of evolving threats.
