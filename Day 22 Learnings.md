# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 22 - It's because I'm kubed, isn't it?

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 22 focused on Kubernetes, a critical tool in modern cloud computing and container orchestration. The task delved into understanding Kubernetes clusters, investigating potential security vulnerabilities, and analyzing misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.

### 2. Tools Used:
##### Kubectl:
The command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters, inspect configurations, and identify potential misconfigurations.
##### Kubernetes Dashboard:
A web interface for managing and monitoring Kubernetes clusters, used to explore permissions and access controls.
##### Containerized Applications:
Analyzed the behavior of deployed applications to identify potential security weaknesses.

### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Kubernetes Fundamentals:
Understanding how Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications.
Exploring the structure of Kubernetes clusters, including nodes, pods, and services.
#### Security in Kubernetes:
Identifying common misconfigurations that attackers can exploit.
Exploring the importance of securing Kubernetes configurations and access controls.
#### Investigating Misconfigurations:
Learning how misconfigured roles and permissions can expose sensitive resources.
Exploring scenarios where insecure configurations allow attackers to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
##### Kubernetes Cluster Analysis:
Developed the ability to navigate and inspect Kubernetes clusters using kubectl and the Kubernetes dashboard.
##### Identifying Security Risks:
Learned to spot misconfigurations in role-based access control (RBAC) and pod security settings.
##### Privilege Escalation Scenarios:
Explored how attackers exploit weak configurations to escalate privileges within a cluster.
##### Best Practices for Kubernetes Security:
Gained insights into securing Kubernetes deployments by implementing least privilege principles, restricting access, and monitoring cluster activity.
##### Hands-on Debugging:
Practiced debugging cluster issues and resolving vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

### 5. Achievement
Day 22 was a highly informative and practical experience in Kubernetes security. It was fascinating to see how misconfigurations could expose critical components of a cluster, emphasizing the importance of secure deployments. This task reinforced my understanding of Kubernetes, while providing essential insights into securing cloud-native applications. By navigating real-world scenarios, I feel better prepared to approach container orchestration and cluster management with a security-first mindset.
