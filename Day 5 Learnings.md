# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 5 - SOC-mas XX-what-ee?

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 5's task focused on exploring the importance of log analysis and understanding how a Security Operations Center (SOC) identifies and addresses threats. It emphasized interpreting and correlating security logs to uncover malicious activity while introducing tools and concepts that SOC analysts rely on daily.

### 2. Tools Used:
Log Analysis Tools: Tools like Kibana, Splunk, or ELK Stack for visualizing and analyzing logs.
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Used for aggregating and correlating data to detect patterns and anomalies.
Command-Line Utilities: Tools for filtering, searching, and analyzing log files manually.

### 3. Concepts Covered:
#### Log Formats:
Understanding different types of logs, such as system logs, application logs, and security event logs.
Recognizing common fields in log entries, such as timestamps, source IPs, and event types.
#### Log Correlation:
How to connect seemingly unrelated log entries to identify potential threats.
Using time-based analysis to track the sequence of events.
#### Threat Detection:
Identifying anomalies, such as failed login attempts, privilege escalations, or unauthorized access.
Spotting patterns indicative of reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
#### SOC Workflows:
The role of SOC analysts in monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.
How alerts are triaged and escalated based on their severity and impact.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
#### Log Parsing and Filtering:
Using tools and scripts to isolate relevant information from large volumes of logs.
Techniques for searching specific fields, such as source IP or error codes.
#### Threat Investigation:
Learning to ask investigative questions, like "Who triggered this alert?" or "What was accessed at this time?"
Tracing an attacker's movements by analyzing logs chronologically.
#### Incident Detection:
Identifying suspicious patterns, such as brute-force attacks or lateral movement.
Validating alerts by cross-referencing logs from multiple sources.
#### SOC Best Practices:
The importance of documentation, alert tuning, and communication during incident response.
How log analysis fits into the broader context of organizational security.

### 5. Achievement
This task provided a hands-on introduction to the essential functions of a SOC analyst. By analyzing logs and correlating events, I gained practical skills in detecting and understanding malicious activity. The exercise underscored the importance of robust logging, regular monitoring, and the critical role of SOC analysts in securing organizational assets.
