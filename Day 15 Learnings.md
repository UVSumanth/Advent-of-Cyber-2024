# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 15 - Be it ever so heinous, there's no place like Domain Controller

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 15 of Advent of Cyber 2024 revolved around understanding and investigating domain controller activity in a network environment. The task presented a scenario involving suspicious activity in a Windows Active Directory environment, challenging me to identify and analyze potential threats or misconfigurations that could compromise its security.

### 2. Tools Used:
#### Event Viewer:
An essential tool for analyzing Windows logs, allowing me to track activities and detect anomalies.
#### PowerShell Commands:
Used to query and extract specific information from the AD environment efficiently.
#### Log Analysis Software:
Facilitated deeper investigation into event logs and their context.


### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Windows Active Directory (AD):
Learning about the central role of a domain controller in managing authentication and authorization within a network.
Understanding common AD threats, such as unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
#### Event Logs and Audit Trails:
Gaining insights into Windows Event Logs and how they can reveal user activities, login attempts, and system changes.
Identifying critical events and filtering out noise to focus on actionable information.
#### Attack Techniques:
Recognizing tactics often used by attackers to gain footholds in AD environments, including lateral movement and unauthorized changes to AD objects.

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
#### Active Directory Security Awareness:
I gained a solid understanding of how attackers target AD environments and the critical measures needed to secure them.
#### Log Analysis Proficiency:
This task sharpened my ability to navigate large event logs, spot unusual patterns, and trace malicious activities effectively.
#### Using PowerShell for Investigation:
I improved my command-line skills, learning how to retrieve valuable data quickly and effectively using PowerShell.
#### Proactive Defense Mindset:
The scenario emphasized the importance of monitoring and responding to suspicious activity proactively to mitigate potential threats.

### 5. Achievement
Day 15 was an eye-opener into the complexities of securing a domain controller and the pivotal role it plays in a networkâ€™s security posture. This task helped me understand the nuances of AD threats and how even small misconfigurations can lead to significant vulnerabilities. It was a rewarding experience to apply my knowledge in a practical scenario, reinforcing both my technical and analytical skills.
