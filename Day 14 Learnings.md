# Advent of Cyber 2024: Day 14 - Even if we're horribly mismanaged, there'll be no sad faces on SOC-mas!

**Summary of Task Completion**

### 1. Overview
Day 14 of the Advent of Cyber 2024 focused on exploring network monitoring and analysis, with a specific emphasis on detecting and understanding unusual activities in network traffic. The task revolved around a scenario where suspicious behavior was identified, and it was up to me to investigate and uncover the details of the issue.

### 2. Tools Used:
#### Wireshark:
A powerful network protocol analyzer that allowed me to inspect packets and pinpoint suspicious traffic.
#### Browser or Command-Line Utilities:
Used to verify insights and understand the behavior of the network traffic.

### 3. General Topics and Concepts Covered:
#### Network Traffic Analysis:
Understanding how to capture and analyze network packets to identify anomalies.
Learning about the structure of network packets and how they can reveal valuable insights during an investigation.
#### Network Protocols:
Examining protocols like HTTP and DNS, their common uses, and how they might be leveraged or abused in cyber incidents.
#### Log Analysis:
Reviewing network logs to piece together what actions occurred and to identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

### 4. Skills and Lessons Learned:
#### Practical Network Analysis:
I developed a stronger understanding of how to navigate through packet captures and focus on relevant data, such as specific protocols or endpoints.
#### Identifying Malicious Activity:
The task provided a hands-on approach to spotting indicators that suggest malicious intent, such as suspicious queries or unusual request patterns.
#### Critical Thinking in Investigations:
The scenario encouraged me to think methodically, filtering through a large dataset to uncover actionable information.
#### Effective Use of Tools:
I enhanced my proficiency with Wireshark, learning tips and tricks to make analysis more efficient and insightful.

### 5. Achievement
Completing Day 14â€™s task reinforced the importance of network monitoring and analysis in cybersecurity. It showcased how real-world threats can manifest through subtle clues in network traffic and emphasized the value of using the right tools to investigate effectively. This task was a great blend of theory and practice, giving me confidence in tackling similar challenges in the future.
